About
This project is my very first end-to-end coding exercise built with the help of Trae AI.
It bundles six common debate-competition timers into one clean, responsive web app:

Format	File
Asian Parliamentary	ap.html
British Parliamentary	bp.html
World Schools (WSDC)	wsdc.html
Junior WSDC (JWSD)	jwsd.html
Public Forum	pf.html
Junior 1 v 1	jr1.html

A landing page (index.html) lets users pick a format via big icon buttons, then each format page handles its own timing rules, prep clocks, and bell alerts.

Why I built it
Learning by doing — I wanted a hands-on way to practise HTML/CSS/JS while seeing how Trae AI can speed up UI iteration.

Classroom need — As a debate coach I constantly switch between formats. Having one lightweight timer saves time and keeps rounds running on schedule.

Open sharing — Fellow teachers and students can fork or remix the code for tournaments, training camps, or club meetings.
